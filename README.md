#CLUSTERING PROJECT

The aim in this project is to classify all Bar-Restaurant venues in Caracas city, so we can evaluate the density of clusters by neighborhoods, and provide the best places to open a new Bar-Restaurant. We can divide the project in three parts: 

o Part 1: consist in ordering and cleaning Dataset 1, so it can be manageable and useful in all libraries required. We have use Foursquare, with Dataset 1 as input, and so we can obtain all venues in Caracas city (Dataset 2). Dataset 2 have been filtered to keep Bar Restaurant venues. Folium library is used to visualize neighborhoods and venues in a map. 

o Part 2: Consist in the analysis of each neighborhood, so we can know the frequency of venues and the common venues per neighborhoods.

o Part 3: Clustering neighborhoods. We used k-means to classify neighborhoods by venues, and observe it in a map, and know how the clusters are distributed in the city.
